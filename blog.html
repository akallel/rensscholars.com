											<h3>Breaking Down Ethnic Barriers - Micah Villanueva</h3>
											<p>
												The question invariably comes at some point. Sometimes it’s more polite, other

times, not so much. “So…what are you?”  I cringe inwardly and grin outwardly. Now 

in my fourth year at the University of Rochester, I can no longer be surprised when I 

get awkward or offensive questions about my ethnicity. Don’t get me wrong; I relish 

the opportunity to speak about my unique background with people. Nonetheless, it’s 

hard to not feel a certain amount of “otherness,” or be a little self-conscious. The 

collective weight of the “what are you?” moments have made it hard to not feel like 

that. Sure, I can laugh about these moments. It’s hard not to (and indeed is 

necessary). But more seriously speaking, my experiences on campus have forced me 

to decide how to treat my ethnicity. Will I leverage it for positive gain? Or will I 

perpetually question, “who am I?” <br>

I’m the son of a Filipino father and a half-Puerto Rican, half-Russian mother. My 

father moved to the States when he was just a toddler. My mother is the daughter of 

two immigrants. Growing up, I lived in Los Angeles and small town Alaska. It is said 

that my background is unique, and of that, I am proud. Beyond this though, it has 

been here in Rochester where I’ve begun to really understand what it means to be 

me. Not because this University is somehow exceptional at fostering interethnic 

conversations or relationships (in fact, quite the opposite). I know that for many 

others, campus is a place where we can fit in everywhere and yet nowhere at the 

same time. The onus is upon us to reach beyond normal barriers of class, race, 

ethnicity, religion, etc, to build relationships. Yet it is this very fact that has enabled 

us to grow in our knowledge of ourselves.<br>

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned in this regard is to embrace the fact 

that I don’t fit into any category. I’ve heard it said to me “Filipino’s aren’t really 

Asians.” I’ve heard that I’m not a legitimate Latino because I don’t speak Spanish 

(even though most Puerto Ricans in the mainland don’t). And of course I’ve been 

called a mutt, mixed, and so on. Offensive? Yes. But I have only used these 

experiences to become more firm in the knowledge of who I am. Jokingly referring 

to myself as being the embodiment of the United Nations, I’m able to respond to the 

“what are you?” question with bold statements about my identity. <br>

This does not mean I’ve moved on from the feeling of “otherness.” There is some 

social anxiety that I still struggle with. I know that I can’t bring up white privilege 

around my white friends, because it won’t lead to anything constructive. I know that 

in some situations I’ll be mistaken for a race that I’m not. I know that even when I’m 

around my friends who are of color, I can’t always fully identify with what they have 

gone through. This brings some uneasiness to me. <br>

Yet at the same time, some of the most memorable moments of my college career 

have been found in building relationships that transcend racial and ethnic 

differences. There is beauty in difference. Where would I be without conversations 

on race with my Jamaican friends? Or what would I have lost had I not cooked and 

shared a Filipino meal with some of my closest friends (who happen to be mostly 

white)? Whether it has been individuals of Caribbean, African, or Latin American 

descent, I have had the privilege of being able to navigate life with people who are 

different than me. We may have been thrust together by circumstance, but we have 

built so much despite that. My only wish is that this could be the only side to the 

story. All too often, it is the other half of the story that is the predominant narrative 

in the lives of minority students here on campus. Personal differences, feelings of 

otherness, and ignorance can demarcate people into “them” and “us.” But we can 

move past this. My narrative is not a singular experience. We can use our negative 

experiences to grow in our knowledge of selves. And through this, we can move past 

ignorance and build relationships that intersect racial and ethnic lines.

																						<p>
If there’s anything I’ve learned from my time as a Renaissance and Global 

Scholar, it’s that my previous achievements are not a safety net but a springboard.  

Us scholars are a dynamic bunch, and I don’t know a single one of us who is content 

to rest upon his laurels. Although I am a Rochester native, this community 

continually finds ways to show me new things. As I intend to demonstrate in today’s 

blog post, my past experiences have not satiated my appetite for new opportunities, 

but only served to aid me in the pursuit. <br>

Before coming to college, I had been competing and performing as a figure 

skater for over a decade. I mostly trained in a skating club based in Jamestown, a 

small town in upstate New York. As my senior year of high school approached, I 

faced a choice of whether or not to continue my skating career or forfeit it for a 

higher education. Forever indecisive, I applied to college, but also to professional ice 

skating jobs with Royal Carribbean Cruises and Disney On Ice. As luck would have it, 

all three found a spot for me. As far as tough decisions go, I can’t complain too much 

about the choices lying in front of me, and I ultimately accepted the offer from 

Disney. Disney usually maintains about seven or eight ice shows simultaneously 

touring in different parts of the world, and every once in a while, an older show gets 

replaced by a new one. As it so happened, they were putting together a brand new 

show in Florida that year, and they needed someone to play the lead part of Peter 

Pan. As anxious as I was to go to college, I was able to recognize a once-in-a-lifetime 

opportunity when I saw it. I took the job, toured over 37 different cities in four 

different countries and by the end of that whirlwind tour I was exhausted, grateful, 

and fundamentally changed as a person in more ways than I can count. <br>

Although offered the opportunity to continue skating, I had learned from 

Disney everything I felt I could, and thus while I was on tour I re-applied to colleges. 

Ironically, my first time around, the thought of going to UofR never even crossed my 

mind, as few high school kids are enticed by the idea of remaining in the same city 

they grew up in right out of high school. However, after seeing the world, I 

reconsidered my position, applied to Rochester, and three years later, I’m a Junior at 

University of Rochester and loving every minute of it. <br>

Today, I am involved in all sorts of campus clubs, and it is ironic that skating 

has been a crucial aid to me in almost all of them. I am an active member of the 

University’s latin dance group, SALSEROS, which performs year-round across 

campus. I remember my tough 80-hour work weeks the first couple of months in 

Disney in the rehearsal period, yet that has translated seamlessly into valuable 

experience I draw upon every day when rehearsing for SALSEROS performances. I 

am also one of University of Rochester’s Neighborhood Ambassadors, in which we 

play leading roles in the off-campus community. We organize large-scale events for 

the community, and just last week we put together an ice skating event with 

hundreds of people showing up for games, food, hot chocolate, and free skating. 

Needless to say, my skating experience proved essential once again, as I spent the 

entire day teaching children the basics of skating, put on an exhibition for people, 

and helping to make the UofR presence known in the 19th ward. <br>

As Renaissance Scholars, we may not all be professional ice skaters, but we 

speak different languages, come from different walks of life, and pursue all sorts of 

unique experiences every day. We all bring something to the table. If you’re like me, 

you’ll express that through your campus clubs and organizations that you get 

involved in, but that is only the first step. We are all going to make a difference one 

day, and as we seek new opportunities, remember not to forget your past 

experiences. They got you this far, and if you take advantage of them, they will get 

you even further.

											<h3>Nina Listro</h3>
<p>
	This past weekend I turned twenty years old. Just writing that feels strange. I didn’t think

turning twenty would be any different from any other birthday; the days leading up to it didn’t

even cause any feelings of excitement or anticipation. Yet, now that the date has actually

passed and I can say “I’m twenty years old”, I find myself aroused by anxiety. No longer am I

a teenager who can just sit back and relax, thinking of the future as this far away land that I

will encounter somewhere down the road.<br>

Now that I’m twenty I feel I need to grab my life by the reins and direct it down a set path; a

path that will lead my to happiness and fulfillment of the self. How daunting this seems! I don’t

even feel remotely close to knowing what this path is supposed to look like, what challenges

and enchanting moments it might bring.<br>

A part of me wants someone to draw me a map, one that guides me down this path of “Nina’s

Life” and warn me beforehand about what there is to come. Things would be less intimidating,

less frightening.<br>

But also much more boring. After contemplating the idea of having a set track of which

internships to take, what to do after college, where to build a house, I realized there wouldn’t

be any excitement, questions, or concerns in my life. I don’t think I’d even call it ‘living’, it

would just be ‘doing’.<br>

I think it’s important to actually live one’s life, or else it seems immoral to even call it one’s life.

Even though things may seem daunting and insecure at this point in life, I think that’s how it’s

supposed to be. Twenty doesn’t have to be this turning point where you know exactly what

you want to do and who you want to be, but it is the time to buckle down and follow what fuels

your most inner passions. It’s going to be impossible to achieve self­fulfillment without doing

that.<br>

So that’s the big epiphany that hit me at twenty years old; now is the time to start fully

focusing on my passions, and from there “Nina’s Life” will unfold slowly but surely. </p>
